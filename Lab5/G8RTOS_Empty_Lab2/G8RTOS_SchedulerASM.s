	.thumb		; Set to thumb mode
	.align 2	; Align by 2 bytes (thumb mode uses allignment by 2 or 4)

; Need to have the address defined in file 
; (label needs to be close enough to asm code to be reached with PC relative addressing)
RunningPtr: .field CurrentlyRunningThread, 32

; G8RTOS_Start
;	Sets the first thread to be the currently running thread
;	Starts the currently running thread by setting Link Register to tcb's Program Counter

; PendSV_Handler
; - Performs a context switch in G8RTOS
; 	- Saves remaining registers into thread stack
;	- Saves current stack pointer to tcb
;	- Calls G8RTOS_Scheduler to get new tcb
;	- Set stack pointer to new stack pointer from new tcb
;	- Pops registers from thread stack
